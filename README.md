# Meals App

The Meals App, built using Flutter, offers users a convenient way to explore and manage meals. The app's home page features two screens: "Categories" and "Favorites," providing easy access to categorized meals and user-favorited items. Users can apply filters to refine meal selections and view details about specific meals, including ingredients and preparation instructions. The app also allows users to add meals to their favorites, which are then accessible from the "Favorites" section on the home screen.
